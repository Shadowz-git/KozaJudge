Wait... what is a Koza? It is a sheep in Polish.

KozaJudge is a basic (also probably stupid) solutions checker for Python excerises. Made by :heart: for [Unical](https://www.unical.it) first year [Computer Science](https://informatica.unical.it/) students. 

If you would like to contribute to this project, here there is a list of things to do.

TODO LIST: 

- Insert a sort of guide before entering the paths

- Read from domjudge-problem.ini and display and/or use the following data: Timelimit, nameproblem

- Create a sort of debug mode for us

- Handle the exception like folder not found or file not found etc..

- Test it on windows. (I'm worried about the paths...)

- Make a decent logo.

- Add license
