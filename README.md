Wait... what is a Koza? It is a sheep in [Polish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/koza#Polish).

KozaJudge is a basic (also probably stupid) solutions checker for Python excerises. Made by :heart: for [Unical](https://www.unical.it) first year [Computer Science](https://informatica.unical.it/) students. 

If you would like to contribute to this project, here there is a list of things to do.

## TODO LIST: 

- Deploy it as a Python Package or make it able to install it on local machine (or maybe make a GUI).

- Insert a sort of guide before entering the paths in the setup. 

- Create a sort of debug mode for us

- Test it on windows. (I'm worried about the paths...)

- Make a decent logo.

- Add license
