# KòzJudge

![Logo](/multimedia/LOGO.png)

Wait... what is a Kòz? It is a sheep in polish.

KòzJudge is a basic (also probably stupid) solutions checker for Python excerises. Made by :heart: for [Unical](https://www.unical.it) first year [Computer Science](https://informatica.unical.it/) students. 

TODO LIST: 

- Read from domjudge-problem.ini and display and/or use the following data: Timelimit, nameproblem

- Create a sort of debug mode for us

- Handle the exception like folder not found or file not found etc..

- Test it on windows. (I'm worried about the paths...)

- Make a decent logo.
