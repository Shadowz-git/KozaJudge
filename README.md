Wait... what is a Koza? It is a sheep in [Polish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/koza#Polish).

KozaJudge is a basic (also probably stupid) solutions checker for Python excerises. Made by :heart: for [Unical](https://www.unical.it) first year [Computer Science](https://informatica.unical.it/) students. 

## [PER IL README IN ITALIANO, CLICCA QUI!](/README_it-IT.md)

## Prerequisites

Before downloading the repository, organise your exercises and solutions folder. 
One folder for the exercises and the second one for the solutions.

The structure of the solutions folder is this:
```
Testcases/
├── excercise1/
│   ├── excercise1_1.in
│   ├── excercise1_1.out
│   ├── excercise1_2.in
│   └── excercise1_2.out
├── excercise2/
│   ├── excercise2_1.in
│   ├── excercise2_1.out
├── excercise3/
│   ├── excercise3_1.in
│   ├── excercise3_1.out

Scripts/
├── excercise1.py
├── excercise2.py
├── excercise3.py
```
For each testcase there is a file with {name_excerise}\_{testcase_number}.in and {name_excerise}_{testcase_number}.out

After that, clone the repository and follow the istructions' program.
